Introduction
************
Open Patent Services (OPS) is a web service which provides access to the EPO's raw
data via a standardised XML interface. It does this using RESTful architecture.

OPS data is extracted from the EPO's bibliographic, worldwide legal status, full-text and image
databases. It is therefore from the same sources as the Espacenet and European Patent Register data.
The number of documents available `recently passed the 100-million mark <https://forums.epo.org/100-million-documents-in-espacenet-7212>`_.

With OPS you can:

- add EPO data to your own software applications or in-house databases
- develop tailor-made clients
- download large volumes of data

You might also want to have a look at some information provided by the EPO:
