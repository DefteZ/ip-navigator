js.jquery.shorten
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery.shorten.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery.shorten.js`: https://github.com/viralpatel/jquery.shorten

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_shorten``) are published to some URL.
