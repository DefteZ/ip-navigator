<div class="row" id="family-members-removed-empty-page">
    <div class="span6">
        An empty result page was reached while having "Remove family members" enabled.
        This indicates some family members have actually been removed from the current
        result page.
        <br/><br/>
        Background: We're fetching results from upstream data sources in chunks of
        <%= data.chunksize %> items, so the removal of family members leads to gaps
        at the end of each result chunk.

        You might want to just skip to the next page containing valid result items:
        <br/><br/>
        <button id="next-page-with-results-button" data-next-page="<%= data.recommended_next_page_local %>" class="btn btn-large btn-default pull-right" role="button">
            Go to result page #<%= data.recommended_next_page_local %>
        </button>
        <% } else { %>
        <div class="pull-right text-large text-align-right">
            <strong>The end of the result list was reached.</strong>
